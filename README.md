HEAL - Hospital Emergency Ambulance Locator

OBJECTIVE : To provide optimum health services in case of emergencies , by using Maps and Geolocation ambulance services along with a virtual assistant to help in the time of panic.

IMPLEMENTATION :

To locate the nearest ambulances near the user with the help of various location APIs, Glide API for an efficient and flexible interface.

In case, no ambulance is available in the vicinity then the nearest hospitals are shown to the user on the map.

Till the ambulance arrives, the virtual assistant will provide the user with the first aid solutions and take note of all the patients symptoms sensed by the user, updating the ambulance and hospital on a real time basis.

There will be a voice assistant in case of panic and for physically disabled users.

Till the ambulance arrives, the user will also be able to view the list of doctors along with their phone numbers, specialty and degree that they may contact in case of emergency.

The number of patients that an ambulance can accommodate will be fixed, so if the status of ambulance is occupied then it will only be able to accept new emergencies after dropping the previous patients.

The user will also have the freedom to choose from the list of hospitals in the city as well as hospitals nearby.

This is not all, a pictorial First Aid Guide is provided in the app for various common emergencies that one may face in order to help them step by step in the process. Seeing the lack of ambulance services in the country, we are also providing a "Volunteer" tab where people can volunteer their cars/vans while vacationing that can be used to provide faster medical reach in case of ambulances not being available.

The driver will get the location of the user calling for the ambulance along with all the details and we have three kinds of ambulances: Mini Van(fastest), Basic Ambulance(Capacity: 1) and Advanced Ambulance(Capacity: 2).

A website to communicate with the hospital using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase is made as well that will update the hospital with the symptoms, ambulance location and patient's details in advance.

APPLICATIONS : It will be helpful in case of health emergencies, and our service will be one tap away for the users to find an ambulance quickly and without any chaos. Also it will help prepare the hospitals for the arrival of the patients.
