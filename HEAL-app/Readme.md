Since it is not released commercially, the driver and login side will have to work using FAKE GPS on one of the devices and logging in as Driver on one and
as Customer on the other and then calling for the ambulance. 

The reason it will show list of hospitals nearby otherwise is because in case no ambulance is find, hospitals nearby is triggered. 

The routing part is written in the code but does not show in the app as it comes under paid Google Map Services.
